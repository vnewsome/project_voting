IPUMS is a microdata service that mostly distributes versions of the Census data and the American Community Survey, but also does a lot of international data. I downloaded a bunch of county level (NHGIS) data that looked interesting or promising. A lot of the files have similar data in each file, but they all have codebooks. You probably want to flip through a few and think about which have interesting covariates for predicting R vs D voting (e.g. education and education*race, income and income*race, etc.).\n",

That's another interesting angle to follow up, if you're interested: Uncertainty driven by the uncertainty in macro projections for the next 6 months."
